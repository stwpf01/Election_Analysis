# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to determine the results of an election by using Python and then writing said results to a text file. The results gathered for this project were the winner, number of votes and percentage of votes of the winner, votes casted per county, and largest turnout for a county. The inital information was provided for in the [election_results.csv](https://github.com/stwpf01/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/election_results.csv)file. Code was then written in Python, found in the [PyPoll_Challenge.py](https://github.com/stwpf01/Election_Analysis/blob/main/PyPoll_Challenge.py) file, to parse through the information and then the results were put into [election_analysis.txt](https://github.com/stwpf01/Election_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/election_analysis.txt) to see them outside a running code terminal. The results of the election will be detailed below in the "Election-Audit Results" section.
